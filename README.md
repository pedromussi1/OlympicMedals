<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The purpose of the machine learning model I have made is to try and correctly predict the outcome of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. The way I will do this is by getting the data from previous editions of the competition, taking into account recent upward trends from certain nations. I have used Jupyter Notebook as my resource for calculating this prediction.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>

<h2>Project Walk-through</h2>

<h3>Adding Items to the List</h3>

</p>

<p>The user can write the name of a new item they want to add to the list and click on "add" to add that item. In this example I chose to add "Need to buy groceries" to the list. You can see on the second image below that the item has been added to the list.</p>

<h3>Deleting an item from the list</h3>

</p>

<p>In case the user wants to delete an item for the list, they can simply click on the button "delete" next to the item they want to delete. In this example, I chose to delete the item "wash the dishes".</p>

<h3>Editing an item on the list</h3>

</p>

<p>In case the user wants to edit an item on the list, they can press the button "edit" next to the item they want to edit. In this example I chose to edit the "I need to clean my car" item on the list and change it to "I need to buy toothpaste".</p>
